# REGI the Financial Guru

Regi is going to be the financial bot which is going to utilize various techniques such as RAG for finding pertinent information to help with financial analysis. 

Additionally, the bot will be using CoA (Chain of Agents), where it will employ various LLM agents which will perform specialized tasks to assist in managing my financial life. 

Currently, the plan is to create an email feed delivered to me which will create news snippets which are digestible by me every morning. 
Over time, the plan will be to use the news information to make predictions on various stocks and cryptos, in which I will be investing in. 

Initially, Regi will perform paper trading so that I can gauge the accuracy in its trades. If Regi begins to make profit, then we will continue. 
If the accuracy is below a certain threshold (consistently losing money), then we will work on employing better tactics to align Regi as a financial guru. 

## Semantic Extracts of News

We scrape news from Reuters and the Yahoo Finance RSS feeds. Over time, we will find better ways to collect up to date information so that we can begin to track it historically, and make market predictions based on them.
